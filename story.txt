Once upon a time there was a man, he walked on the road.He saw a Wolf running towards him, followed by a hunter.
The hunter loaded his gun and aimed at the wolf.

He pulled the trigger and saw that the bullet went through the roof of the wolf's mouth. The sound alerted the other wolves and they also charged at the hunter.
